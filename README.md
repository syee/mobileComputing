This is the repository for Mobile Computing CPSC 415 at Trinity College. We will be creating mobile apps with a focus on Android and iOS operating systems. Topics include event-driven programming, the client-server model, location awareness (GPS), service management, and mobile security. The course will also address some of the broader impacts of mobile computing on privacy, health, and the economy. The course will be project based and students will build several mobile apps for the Android platform.

This is a projects-based course, which means that students will work on several mobile computing projects, individually and in pairs. The projects will start simple and become more complex as we learn more principles of mobile computing and more features of the Android and iOS platforms.
